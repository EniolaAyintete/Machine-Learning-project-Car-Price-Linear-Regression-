# Machine-Learning-project-Car-Price-Linear-Regression-
*Overview:*
This project utilizes linear regression and lasso regression to predict car prices based on various features. The goal is to compare predicted prices with actual prices, providing insights into the factors influencing car pricing.

*Target Variable:*

* Car Price

*Methodology:*

1. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values
2. Model Selection: Linear Regression
3. Model Evaluation:  metrics used, e.g., mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared

*Results:*

-Using Linear Regression I found out that the Predicted Prices are very close to the Actual price, same Result also after using Lasso Regression

*Model Implementation:*

* scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Linear regression, Lasso Regression
